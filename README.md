# Portfolio Projects

These projects play a significant role in helping me understand the significance of cleaning and organizing data for querying and analysis, uncovering trends and insights before drawing meaningful conclusions for communicating critical findings and strategic decision making.

Data Analysis Process involved: Data Cleaning, Exploration, Manipulation, Visualization using MySQL, SQLite, RStudio, Tableau and NumPy and Pandas Series and Dataframes in Python.

I showcase my proficiency in SQL, Excel and Python (its data analysis libraries i.e. Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn) as I developed this portfolio. With data gathered from a variety of sources, I performed data assessment prior to cleaning the data and documented every step including analyses and visualizations using Python, Tableau and SQL.
