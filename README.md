# Portfolio Projects

These projects play a significant role in helping me understanding the significance of cleaning and oganizing data for querying and analysis, organizing data, uncovering trends and insights before drawing meaningful conclusions for communicating critical findings and strategic decision making.

Data Analysis Process involved: Data Cleaning, Exploration, Manipulation Visualization using MySQL, SQLite, RStudio, Tableau and NumPy and Pandas Series and Dataframes in Python.

I showcase my proficiency in SQL, Excel and Python (its data analysis libraries i.e. Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn) as I develop this portfolio. With data gathered from a variety of sources, I performed data assessment prior to cleaning the data and documented every step including analyses and visualizations using Python, Tableau and SQL.
